# what is precision in machine learning

Precision in machine learning measures the quality of a model's positive predictions by calculating the ratio of correctly identified positive instances (true positives) to all instances predicted as positive (true positives + false positives). This metric is crucial when the cost of false positives is high, such as in fraud detection or medical diagnoses[^1][^2][^3].

### Definition and Formula

Precision is mathematically defined as:

$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives (TP)}}{\text{True Positives (TP)} + \text{False Positives (FP)}}
$$

- **True Positives**: Correctly predicted positive instances.
- **False Positives**: Negative instances incorrectly labeled as positive[^1][^2][^5].

For example:

- In a customer attrition model, if 100 customers are predicted to unsubscribe and 80 of them actually do, precision is $$
\frac{80}{100} = 0.8
$$ (80%)[^1].
- For product recommendations, if 40 out of 50 recommended items align with user interests, precision is 80%[^5].


### Key Applications

Precision is prioritized in scenarios where false positives carry significant consequences:

1. **Fraud Detection**: Minimizing false alarms to avoid unnecessary investigations[^2][^8].
2. **Medical Testing**: Reducing incorrect diagnoses to prevent unwarranted treatments[^7][^8].
3. **Spam Filtering**: Ensuring flagged emails are genuinely spam to avoid missing important messages[^4][^6].

### Trade-offs with Recall

Models typically balance precision and recall (the ability to capture all true positives):

- **High precision** often results in **lower recall**, as stricter criteria reduce false positives but may miss true positives.
- **High recall** increases false positives, lowering precision[^1][^3][^7].

| Metric | Focus | Formula | Use Case |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Precision | Accuracy of positive predictions | $$
\frac{TP}{TP + FP}
$$ | Minimizing false positives |
| Recall | Coverage of actual positives | $$
\frac{TP}{TP + FN}
$$ | Minimizing false negatives |

### Limitations

- **Imbalanced Data**: Precision becomes less meaningful if the positive class is extremely rare (e.g., 1-2 instances)[^4][^6].
- **Context Dependency**: It should be evaluated alongside recall and other metrics (e.g., F1-score, ROC-AUC) for a complete performance assessment[^1][^8].

For instance, a model predicting all passengers as terrorists achieves perfect recall but near-zero precision, while a model flagging only one true terrorist might have perfect precision but poor recall[^7]. Adjusting classification thresholds helps balance these metrics based on use-case requirements[^7][^8].
